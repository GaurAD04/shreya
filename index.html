    const message = `Dearest,

I am a fool, I‚Äôve always been one. But this time I don‚Äôt feel troubled about it for I am a fool for you. You added colours to my life and such is your grace, you are just gracefully.

You‚Äôve given me moments that I will never forget. I remember seeing you for the first time on that natural ice cream parlour, my heart wasn‚Äôt ready for what was to come as it skipped a couple of beats the moment it saw you, as they say, ‚Äúyou came in like a shot of espresso‚Äù. I remember talking continuously as if my inner child saw his happiness again, for you are my happiness now.

I remember the first time we went to the beach and I held your hand, even though it was for a brief moment it felt like happiness just filled up my body.

I remember watching ‚ÄúLove Aaj Kal‚Äù with you. That whole day was just ineffable. I remember kissing you on the forehead for the first time, holding you in my arms. You gave me the scent of the woman that I‚Äôll never forget. And then it happened, the kiss. It felt as if the world stopped, the slight tension to it, and the way it made me feel is an experience that I don‚Äôt want any other human to have.

And then came the happiest day of my life, 29th August, the day I said I love you to you. You don‚Äôt know this but I did sit with that feeling for a long time before confessing and I know that it‚Äôs one of the most ugly confessions known to mankind but the only thing that I can assure you of is that whatever I said that day was as true as it can be.

I wish to know you more miss Darcy, I will mess up as I have before but please allow me to be a part of your beautiful world. Holding you and kissing your face is a privilege that I dread to lose now.

I‚Äôll see you with lilies the next time I meet you. I did find someone I love, I found love, I found you.

Completely Yours,
Aditya (the fool)
